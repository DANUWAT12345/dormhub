# DormHub Project Summary

## Overview
DormHub is a backend REST API service designed for managing dormitory room occupancies and status. It provides a centralized system to track which rooms are available, occupied, or disabled (e.g., for maintenance).

## Technology Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Framework:** FastAPI (High-performance, easy-to-use web framework)
- **Database:** MongoDB (Document store for flexible data management)
- **Server:** Uvicorn (ASGI server)
- **Documentation:** Swagger UI & ReDoc (Auto-generated by FastAPI)

## Architecture
The project follows a **Clean Architecture** (Layered) pattern to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability:
- **API Layer (`api/`)**: Handles HTTP requests and routing.
- **Application Layer (`application/`)**: Contains business logic and use cases (Service classes).
- **Domain Layer (`domain/`)**: Defines core entities and repository interfaces.
- **Infrastructure Layer (`infrastructure/`)**: Implements external interfaces (e.g., database access).

## Key Features
1. **Room Management:**
   - Register new rooms.
   - Retrieve room details.
   - List all rooms with optional status filtering.

2. **Status Control (State Machine):**
   - **Occupy:** Mark a room as currently in use.
   - **Free:** Mark a room as available for new occupants.
   - **Disable:** distinct status for rooms not in service.

3. **Operational:**
   - Health check endpoint (`/health`).
   - Environment variable configuration (via `.env`).
   - CORS middleware support.

## API Endpoints
- `GET /` : Welcome message.
- `GET /health` : System health check.
- `POST /rooms` : Create a new room.
- `GET /rooms` : List rooms (optional `?status=` filter).
- `GET /rooms/{id}` : Get specific room details.
- `PATCH /rooms/{id}/occupy` : Set status to OCCUPIED.
- `PATCH /rooms/{id}/free` : Set status to AVAILABLE.
- `PATCH /rooms/{id}/disable` : Set status to NOTAVAILABLE.
